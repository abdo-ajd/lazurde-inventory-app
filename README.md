## Pushing Updates to GitHub

To save your changes and push them to your GitHub repository, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

1.  **Stage your changes:** This prepares all modified files to be saved.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Commit your changes:** This saves a snapshot of your files with a descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive message about the changes"
    ```
    *Replace "Your descriptive message..." with a brief summary of what you did (e.g., "Add product color customization").*

3.  **Push your changes:** This uploads your saved changes to GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
